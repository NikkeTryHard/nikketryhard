I build software and argue with bugs for a living.
Sometimes I win.

## What I focus on
- Building practical AI and automation tools that solve real workflow problems.
- Shipping quickly, then polishing like that was the plan from the start.
- Writing code future-me can read without filing a complaint.

## Tech I use a lot
- Languages: Python, TypeScript, Rust
- Tooling: Docker, GitHub Actions, Bun, VS Code
- Interests: AI infrastructure, developer tooling, automation, reverse engineering

## Featured projects
- zerogravity: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini-compatible proxy with anti-detection traffic behavior.
- AIstudioProxyAPI: Fast API proxy for AI Studio workflows and API interoperability.
- tenhou-to-mjai: Converts Tenhou logs into mjai format for AI training pipelines.
- tach-core: Pytest-inspired execution model with fine-grained memory snapshots.
